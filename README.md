# Text Summarization

> **Abstract** : This mini-project implements an NLP-based text summarization system. It reads text from a file, preprocesses sentences, and removes stopwords. Using a similarity matrix, it ranks sentences and selects top-n relevant ones. The summary captures main points from the original text, providing a condensed version. The system uses NLTK and NetworkX for NLP tasks and PageRank. Valuable for information retrieval, content analysis, and document summarization.
